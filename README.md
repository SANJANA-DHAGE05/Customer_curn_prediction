📌 Customer Churn Prediction – End-to-End ML Project
🔍 Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical business problem where organizations aim to identify customers who are likely to discontinue their services.
This project predicts customer churn using machine learning and provides an interactive web interface for real-time predictions.

🎯 Objective

To build and deploy a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer will churn or stay, based on customer attributes.
